# DSA Playground

## Overview

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Playground! 

This repository serves as a dedicated space where I document my personal journey of learning and implementing fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms. The implementations may not be perfect, but they are designed to illustrate the functionality of each concept.

## What's Inside

Explore the repository to find:

### Data Structures:

- Linked Lists ✓
- Trees
    - Binary Search Tree ✓
    - AVL Tree ✓
    - Red-Black Tree ✓
- Graphs
    - Undirected/Directed Graphs with Adjacency Matrix ✓
    - Undirected/Directed Graphs with Adjacency List ✓
- Hash Tables (I tried to reproduce std::map) ✓


### Algorithms:

- Searching and Sorting
    - Fibonacci Series with Memoization ✓
    - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort ✓
- Dynamic Programming
    - Binary Search ✓
    - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) ✓
- Greedy Algorithms ✓

## Why This Repository?

This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation of my progress in mastering DSA concepts. 

Each code snippet and implementation reflects my understanding and hands-on exploration.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback!
